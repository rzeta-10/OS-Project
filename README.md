# Question 1: 

## üöÄ Getting Started

To try out `xv6CustomizeSystemCalls`, clone the repository and compile the code as follows:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rzeta-10/OS-Project.git
cd Project1_xv6CustomizeSystemCalls

# Compile xv6
make qemu

```
### The following are the procedures of adding our exemplary system call ps() to xv6.

 - Add name to `syscall.h`:
 
 ``` 
 // System call numbers
#define SYS_fork    1
..........
#define SYS_close  21
#define SYS_ps    22
 ``` 
  - Add function prototype to `defs.h`:
  ``` 
  // proc.c
void            exit(void);
......
void            yield(void);
int             ps ( void ); 
  ```   
 
 - Add function prototype to `user.h`:
  ``` 
    // system calls
int fork(void);
.....
int uptime(void);
int ps ( void );
   ``` 
     
  - Add function call to `sysproc.c`:
  
   ``` 
uint64
sys_ps ( void )
{
  return cps ();
}  
   ```
        
   - Add call to `usys.S`:
   
   ```
    SYS_ps
   ```
       
   - Add call to `syscall.c`:
   
   ```   
extern int sys_chdir(void);
.....
extern int sys_ps(void);
.....
static int (*syscalls[])(void) = {
[SYS_fork]    sys_fork,
.....
[SYS_close]   sys_close,
[SYS_ps]     sys_ps,
};    
   ```
     
     
   - Add code to `proc.c`:
    
   ``` 
    //current process status
int
ps()
{
struct proc *p;

// Enable interrupts on this processor.
sti();

 // Loop over process table looking for process with pid.
acquire(&wait_lock);
printf("name \t pid \t state \n");
for(p = proc; p < &proc[NPROC]; p++){
   if ( p->state == SLEEPING )
     printf("%s \t %d  \t SLEEPING \n ", p->name, p->pid );
   else if ( p->state == RUNNING )
     printf("%s \t %d  \t RUNNING \n", p->name, p->pid );
    else if ( p->state == RUNNABLE )
      printf("%s \t %d  \t RUNNABLE \n", p->name, p->pid );
      else if ( p->state == ZOMBIE )
      printf("%s \t %d  \t ZOMBIE \n", p->name, p->pid );
      else if ( p->state == USED )
      printf("%s \t %d  \t USED \n", p->name, p->pid );
}

release(&wait_lock);

return 22;
}

   ``` 
 
  - Create testing file `ps.c` with code shown below:
   ```
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "kernel/stat.h"
#include "user/user.h"
#include "kernel/fs.h"
#include "kernel/fcntl.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
ps();

exit(0);
}
  
   ```

### `ps` - List Process Status
```bash
ps
```

# Question 2: UNIX-like shell program

---

# üêö `csh` - A Custom Shell in C

Welcome to **`csh`**, a custom shell written in C that brings the power of basic UNIX-like commands right to your fingertips! Designed to provide a smooth and intuitive command-line experience, `csh` supports essential file and text manipulation commands, making it a great project for exploring low-level system programming.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Built-in Commands**: 
  - **`ls`** - List directory contents
  - **`cat`** - Display file contents
  - **`grep`** - Search for patterns within files
  - **`wc`** - Count words, lines, and characters in files
  - **`mv`** - Move or rename files
  - **`rm`** - Remove files

## üöÄ Getting Started

To try out `Csh`, clone the repository and compile the code as follows:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rzeta-10/OS-Project.git
cd Project2_Csh

# Compile the shell program
make clean
make

# Run the shell
./cshell
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Once `csh` is running, you can start using the supported commands just as you would in a typical UNIX shell. Here are a few examples with images of each command in action:

### `ls` - List directory contents
```bash
ls
```
![ls command output](Project2_Csh/images/image.png)

### `cat` - Display contents of a file
```bash
cat filename.txt
```
![cat command output](Project2_Csh/images/cat.png)

### `grep` - Search for patterns within files
```bash
grep 'pattern' filename.txt
```
![grep command output](Project2_Csh/images/grep.png)

### `wc` - Count lines, words, and characters in a file
```bash
wc filename.txt
```
![wc command output](Project2_Csh/images/wc.png)

### `mv` - Move or rename a file
```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```
![mv command output](Project2_Csh/images/mv_1.png)

### `rm` - Delete a file
```bash
rm filename.txt
```
![rm command output](Project2_Csh/images/rm_1.png)

### `date` - Display the current date and time
```bash
date
```
![date command output](Project2_Csh/images/date.jpeg)

### `calc` - Perform arithmetic calculations
```bash
calc 10 + 5
calc 15 / 3
calc 7 * 8
```
![calc command output](Project2_Csh/images/calc.jpeg)

### `todo` - Manage a to-do list
```bash
todo add "Finish homework"
todo list
todo delete 1
```
![todo command output](Project2_Csh/images/todo.jpeg)


## üìö Project Structure

- **`main.c`** - Launches a new terminal instance and executes the custom shell `shell.c`
- **`shell.c`** - Core implementation of the shell.
- **`Makefile`** - For building the project with ease.
- **`README.md`** - You‚Äôre reading it!

## ü§ñ Built With

- **C** - For low-level system programming and managing system calls.
- **UNIX System Calls** - For executing commands, handling files, and managing processes.

## üí° Why `csh`?

This project is a deep dive into understanding how a shell operates at a fundamental level, making it a great hands-on experience with system-level programming. It‚Äôs compact, practical, and covers essential shell functionality, perfect for anyone curious about what goes on behind the scenes of a command-line interface.
