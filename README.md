# **Linux Command Implementation**

Welcome to the world of simple Linux commands implemented in C! This repository contains implementations for some of the most commonly used Linux commands, providing you with the functionality to execute them from your very own shell. Each command has been designed to mimic the behavior of the standard Linux commands.

---

## **Commands Implemented** 🔥

### 1. **`ls` - List Directory Contents** 📂

The `ls` command lists all the files and directories within your current working directory. By default, it shows a concise view. Use `ls -l` for a more detailed list with file permissions, ownership, and size.

```bash
$ ls
```

### 2. **`cat` - Concatenate and Display File Content** 📜

The `cat` command is used to display the contents of a file. If the file is too large, it outputs the entire content at once. It can also be used to concatenate multiple files into one.

```bash
$ cat 3.txt
Hello Rohan!
```

### 3. **`grep` - Search for Patterns in Files** 🔍

With `grep`, you can search through the contents of files for a specific pattern. It supports regular expressions and returns all matching lines.

```bash
$ grep "Rohan" 3.txt
Hello Rohan!
```

**Use case**: Searching for a keyword inside files across directories.

### 4. **`wc` - Word, Line, and Character Count** 📏

The `wc` command gives you the word, line, and character count of a file. A powerful tool when you need quick file statistics.

```bash
$ wc 3.txt
0 2 11 3.txt
```

**Details**:  
- **0** = Number of lines
- **2** = Number of words
- **11** = Number of characters

### 5. **`cp` - Copy Files** 📤

The `cp` command copies a file from a source to a destination. It’s like creating a backup or transferring a file to a different location.

```bash
$ cp source.txt destination.txt
File copied from source.txt to destination.txt
```

**Use case**:  
Create a backup of important files.

### 6. **`mv` - Move or Rename Files** 📦

With `mv`, you can move a file to another directory or rename it. If the destination is a directory, it moves the file to that directory; otherwise, it renames the file.

```bash
$ mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

**Use case**:  
Organize files by renaming or moving them to different directories.

### 7. **`rm` - Remove Files or Directories** 🗑️

The `rm` command is used to remove files or directories. Be cautious, as deleted files cannot be easily recovered. Use `rm -r` to delete directories recursively.

```bash
$ rm unwantedfile.txt
```

### **Features and How to Use** 💻

These commands are implemented directly in C and can be executed in your terminal. To use them:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linux-commands.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd linux-commands
    ```

3. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    gcc -o shell shell.c
    ```

4. Run your shell:
    ```bash
    ./shell
    ```
